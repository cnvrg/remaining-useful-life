You can use this blueprint to use a particular model to predict results for if a machine is likely to fail within given cycles or not using your own customized dataset. For using this pretrained RUL model, you will need to create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be integrated with your data and application, in minutes.

Click on Use Blueprint button
In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
You will be redirected to your endpoint
You can use the Try it Live section with a single row of data to check your model
You can also integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page
Congrats! You have deployed an API endpoint that detects about-to-fail machines amongst a larger machine pool!
